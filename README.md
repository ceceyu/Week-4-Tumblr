# Tumblr Prototype
A tumblr prototype using animations and custom container views

Time spent: 6 hours

Notes: Did all the optionals for the first time (yay). Used <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=loading%20png%20swift">this tutorial</a> to create the loading animation.

With more time, would have figured out how to make the "Nevermind" button overlap the tabs, and would have made smarter logic for tab selected states and dismissing the bobbing tooltip.

##Project Requirements
- Tapping on Home, Search, Account, or Trending should show the respective screen and highlight the tab bar button.
- Compose button should modally present the compose screen.
- Optional: Compose screen is faded in while the buttons animate in.
- Optional: Login button should show animate the login form over the view controller.
- Optional: Discover bubble should bob up and down unless the SearchViewController is tapped.
- Added: Spinner on home view spins upon load
